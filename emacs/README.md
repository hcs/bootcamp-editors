To install these emacs dotfiles:

1. Clone the top level repository
2. cd into this (emacs) directory
3. run

     ./install.sh

This will create a symlink in your home directory to these files. Make sure to make
backups of your existing .emacs and .emacs.d files/directories (the script
will prompt you to do so).
